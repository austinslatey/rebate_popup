# rebate_popup
I WANT to create a popup in Shopify THAT alerts the user of a special cash back rebate on specific items by one retailer inside my shopify store.

This popup should be activated starting September 15th and deactivated after November 15th 2025

## Implementation Ideas
I have been given a PDF file with the items that qualify for cash back and the rebate form for the user to print out/complete.

- What I need to be shown in the popup
    - The amount of items is short enough to be able to list all of them, maybe a carousel of all items and if a user likes a product, they are able to view more details about the product on it's product page. (If possible)

- Need to find a solution for the user to either print the rebate form immediately, or possibly emailed to them to print at a later date. 
    - Potentially using SMTP Mailer system
